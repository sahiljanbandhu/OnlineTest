Java history is interesting to know. The history of java starts from Green Team. Java team members (also known as Green Team), initiated a revolutionary task to develop a language for digital devices such as set-top boxes, televisions etc.

For the green team members, it was an advance concept at that time. But, it was suited for internet programming. Later, Java technology as incorporated by Netscape.


Currently, Java is used in internet programming, mobile devices, games, e-business solutions etc. There are given the major points that describes the history of java.

1) James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton initiated the Java language project in June 1991. The small team of sun engineers called Green Team.

2) Originally designed for small, embedded systems in electronic appliances like set-top boxes.

3) Firstly, it was called "Greentalk" by James Gosling and file extension was .gt.

4) After that, it was called Oak and was developed as a part of the Green project.

Java History from Oak to Java
Why sun choosed "Oak" name?

5) Why Oak? Oak is a symbol of strength and choosen as a national tree of many countries like U.S.A., France, Germany, Romania etc.

6) In 1995, Oak was renamed as "Java" because it was already a trademark by Oak Technologies.
Why sun choosed "Java" name?

7) Why they choosed java name for java language? The team gathered to choose a new name. The suggested words were "dynamic", "revolutionary", "Silk", "jolt", "DNA" etc. They wanted something that reflected the essence of the technology: revolutionary, dynamic, lively, cool, unique, and easy to spell and fun to say.

According to James Gosling "Java was one of the top choices along with Silk". Since java was so unique, most of the team members preferred java.

8) Java is an island of Indonesia where first coffee was produced (called java coffee).

9) Notice that Java is just a name not an acronym.

10) Originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which is now a subsidiary of Oracle Corporation) and released in 1995.

11) In 1995, Time magazine called Java one of the Ten Best Products of 1995.

12) JDK 1.0 released in(January 23, 1996).

                                    Java is a programming language and a platform.

Java is a high level, robust, secured and object-oriented programming language.

Platform: Any hardware or software environment in which a program runs, is known as a platform. Since Java has its own runtime environment (JRE) and API, it is called platform.

                            1. Lots of information

Due to how long Java has been around, almost any question you can imagine has already been asked, answered, indexed, and democratically perfected through upvotes on the Internet. It is seriously hard to stump a search engine with a Java coding problem.
2. An incredible toolset

Java has a very rich API, and an incredible supporting open source ecosystem. There are tools upon tools for just about everything you would like to do. There’s also an amazing community driven process that ensures growth in the right direction
3. Software that leads by example

Java is an Object Oriented language. It internally embraces best practices of object oriented design and strongly suggests that you learn and follow them. It also heavily promotes correct usage and many of the documented Design Patterns use Java as the language de facto. Understanding design patterns can lead to much more maintainable code.
4. Killer editors

The IDEs available for Java will blow your mind. Due to its strong typing, you’ll not only be notified immediately of errors, but you’ll also be given suggestions that will refactor and reformat your code with clear explanations and extreme ease. After using them, most people wonder how they ever coded before.
5. Omnipresence

Java is running just about everywhere you can imagine. It’s usually where most large applications end up due to its scalability, stability, and maintainability. There’s also currently a gigantic push in the Java community to be the leader of the IoT (Internet of Things). And it’s coming. Very fast. There’ll be a time in the near future when your alarm clock will automatically start brewing your coffee pot, and it’ll most likely be Java doing that.
6. Lots of available jobs

There are tons of open positions waiting for you due to Java’s widespread reach. Many different sectors embrace the language, and you can be pretty certain you’ll land a job in just about any job market you’d like.
7. Android adoption


All Android Apps are written in Java. By taking our Android Development track, you can publish that app you’ve always dreamed of building.
8. Ease of learning

Java is a verbose language, which at first can seem daunting. However, after learning the basics you’ll find that you can easily grab onto more advanced concepts because the code is very explicit. Plus, there are great courses (wink, wink, nudge, nudge) out there that can ease you into this powerful language.

           Java was called Oak at the beginning

Original name for Java was Oak. Java legend has it that a big oak tree that grew outside the developer James Gosling’s window. It was eventually changed to Java by Sun’s marketing department when Sun lawyers found that there was already a computer company registered as Oak.

Another legend has it that Gosling and his gang of programmers went out to the local cafe to discuss names and wound up naming it Java. There seems to be some truth in this as the “0xCafeBabe” magic number in the class files was named after the Cafe where the Java team used to go for coffee.



Java was invented by accident

James Gosling was working at Sun Labs, around 1992. Gosling and his team was building a set-top box and started by “cleaning up” C++ and wound up with a new language and runtime. Thus Java or Oak came into being

Its pays to learn Java

The median salary of a Java developer is $83,975.00. Yes, it pays to be a Java developer and programmers are milking it. There are about 9 million Java developers in the world.



Java is second most popular language after C

Though many would argue that Java is all time favourite among developers, it is second most popular programming language after C. Java is ranked #2 in popularity among programming languages, according to the programming languages popularity tracking website, tiobe.com.




JUnit Testing Framework

The JUnit Testing Framework is currently the top used Java technology. Its stability and popularity can be deduced from the fact that almost 4 out of 5 Java developers or 70 % developers out there used JUnit Testing Framework.



Java is the go to tool for enterprises

95 percent of enterprises use Java for programming. That is hell lot more than C and other languages put together.


The Duke

The Java mascot, ‘The Duke’ was created by Joe Palrang. Palrang is the same guy who has worked on the Hollywood blockbuster, Shrek.



Java and Android

Java practically runs on 1billion plus smartphones today because Google’s Android operating system uses Java APIs.
